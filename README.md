# HTML CODE REFORMATION 

## Changes committed
1. [General Info](#general-info)
In this project I was tasked with fixing a button and changing the html code so that it fit a semantic standard.
2. [FAQs](#faqs) on line 26 in the index.html file I changed the code for id="search-engine-optimization"              class="search-engine-optimization">. By adding the id="search-engine-optimization" I was able to link it to the code on line 16.
